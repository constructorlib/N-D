1. After almost giving up on web developing as a whole, I started doing it again.
    Although I forgot almost everything, today I was able to catch up with what I was doing a month ago.
    Plus learned quite a lot about git, which is extremely fun!
2. No catching up in the past 25 minutes. Though made a pretty decent contact website.
    Decent as in maybe it could work in 2007 websites. Also no need to have a form for btn, lol.
    You can have a button IN <a href="">
3. Tables are old and I do not really thing I can use them. Regardless, them having cellpadding saved me from the tables looking ugly. 
4. Been left without a laptop for quite some time now. Now back. Today's Hot Topic is CSS.
